## 6.0.0

### Breaking changes
- **iOS upgraded to Braintree SDK v7** (from v5), fixing the Xcode 26 hard build failure caused by
  `UIApplication.windows` being treated as `-Werror` under `-Wdeprecated-declarations`. Thanks to
  [@jmhodges01](https://github.com/jmhodges01) for reporting.
- **Minimum iOS deployment target is now 16.0** (required by Braintree v7).
- **Native iOS Drop-in SDK removed.** `braintree-ios-drop-in` has no v7-compatible release, so on
  iOS (and web) `BraintreeDropIn.start` now presents a cross-platform Flutter payment sheet. Android
  continues to use the native Drop-in UI.
- **`BraintreeDropIn.start` now requires a `BuildContext`:** `start(context, request)` (the Flutter
  sheet needs it to present).

### Features
- **Swift Package Manager support** for iOS (alongside CocoaPods). The iOS plugin is now pure Swift
  and ships an `ios/braintree_flutter_plus/Package.swift`, which declares a `FlutterFramework`
  dependency so the plugin builds under Flutter's SPM integration (Flutter 3.44+). The example app
  has been migrated off CocoaPods to SPM.
- New `Braintree.requestApplePayNonce()` for the native Apple Pay sheet on iOS.
- `Braintree.tokenizeCreditCard()` and `requestPaypalNonce()` gained an optional
  `collectDeviceData` parameter (plus 3D Secure / billing-address parameters on
  `tokenizeCreditCard`); `BraintreePaymentMethodNonce` now carries an optional `deviceData` field.

### Fixes
- Fixed `BraintreeDropInRequest.toJson` sending `cardEnabled` for the `paypalEnabled` flag.

## 5.2.1

- Credit [lucavenir](https://github.com/lucavenir) for the web platform implementation in 5.2.0.

## 5.2.0

### Features

  - Credit card tokenization on web using `Braintree.tokenizeCreditCard()`
  - PayPal vault and checkout flows on web using `Braintree.requestPaypalNonce()`
  - PayPal flow renders an overlay with the official PayPal Buttons component
  - Braintree JS SDK loaded dynamically from CDN (no manual `<script>` tag needed)
- Updated example app to demonstrate web support

## 5.1.1
- Fixed environment constraints to support older Flutter/Dart versions.
- No functional changes from 5.1.0.

## 5.1.0

## 5.0.5

### Features
- **New Custom UI for Credit Card Tokenization**: Introduced a customizable, full-screen credit card form as a modern replacement for the deprecated Drop-in UI.
- **Navigation Helper**: Added `Braintree.showCreditCardForm()` to easily present the credit card form screen.

### Fixes & Improvements
- **Input Validation**: Added robust validation for card number, expiration date, and CVV fields to prevent submission errors.
- **Card Number Formatting**: The card number field now automatically formats the input into groups of four digits for better readability.

### Breaking Changes
- **Deprecation of Drop-in**: `BraintreeDropInRequest` is now marked as deprecated. Developers should migrate to the new custom UI flow using `Braintree.showCreditCardForm()`.

## 5.0.4

*   **Feature**: Added an optional `amount` field to `BraintreeCreditCardRequest`.
*   **Details**: This `amount` is returned with the `BraintreePaymentMethodNonce` result and can be used for display purposes in the UI (e.g., "You are about to pay $X.XX").
*   **Important**: The `amount` passed on the client-side is for display only. The actual transaction amount must still be specified on the server-side when creating the transaction with the nonce. This maintains PCI compliance by ensuring the server controls the final charge.
*   **Fix**: Resolved Android build error related to missing `Serializable` import.
*   **Fix**: Resolved iOS build error caused by an incorrect force-unwrap on a non-optional dictionary.

## 5.0.3
